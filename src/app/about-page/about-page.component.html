    We are a group of students from Computer Enginering Department of
    <strong>Government Polytechnic Mumbai</strong>, Maharashtra, India who
    sought to overcome a problem as our Final Year Major Project which we faced
    in Online Shopping. We were given a task in the Course Computer Networks to
    create a theoretical lab with Networking Setup for a budget of 1Lac for 10
    PCs and their networking peripherals with them being of highest quality and
    as well as not over-budget. We found the task very easy but at the same time
    tedious to do so since different products were at different prices at
    different sites and of different qualities. Today majority of people prefer
    to buy-in products quickly from E-commerce giants such as Amazon and
    Flipkart who fluctuate prices for profit. This website was designed to
    provide customers with information about the products they wish to buy and
    also allowing them to find the best price for them across multiple sites.
    All free of cost.
